We accomplish this by using a learned world model of the agent system to forecast full agent trajectories over long time horizons. Real world systems involve significant sources of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty that compound and interact over time in the trajectory forecasts. We develop a deep generative world model that quantifies aleatoric uncertainty while incorporating the effects of epistemic uncertainty during the learning process. We show on two reinforcement learning problems that our uncertainty model produces calibrated outcome uncertainty estimates over the full trajectory horizon.},

  abstract = {The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to bring transparency to today's powerful but opaque deep learning models. While local XAI methods explain individual predictions in the form of attribution maps, thereby identifying `where' important features occur (but not providing information about `what' they represent), global explanation techniques visualize what concepts a model has generally learned to encode. Both types of method thus provide only partial insights and leave the burden of interpreting the model's reasoning to the user. Here we introduce the Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) approach, which combines the local and global perspectives and thus allows answering both the `where' and `what' questions for individual predictions. We demonstrate the capability of our method in various settings, showcasing that CRP leads to more human interpretable explanations and provides deep insights into the model's representation and reasoning through concept atlases, concept-composition analyses, and quantitative investigations of concept subspaces and their role in fine-grained decision-making.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing anatomical shapes from sparse or partial measurements relies on prior knowledge of shape variations that occur within a given population. Such shape priors are learned from example shapes, obtained by segmenting volumetric medical images. For existing models, the resolution of a learned shape prior is limited to the resolution of the training data. However, in clinical practice, volumetric images are often acquired with highly anisotropic voxel sizes, e.g. to reduce image acquisition time in MRI or radiation exposure in CT imaging. The missing shape information between the slices prohibits existing methods to learn a high-resolution shape prior. We introduce a method for high-resolution shape reconstruction from sparse measurements without relying on high-resolution ground truth for training. Our method is based on neural implicit shape representations and learns a continuous shape prior only from highly anisotropic segmentations. Furthermore, it is able to learn from shapes with a varying field of view and can reconstruct from various sparse input configurations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on two anatomical structures: vertebra and distal femur, and successfully reconstruct high-resolution shapes from sparse segmentations, using as few as three orthogonal slices.},

This pattern diverges from the more uniformly distributed anisotropy observed in encoders. In addition, we found that the intrinsic dimension of embeddings increases in the initial phases of training, indicating an expansion into higher-dimensional space. This fact is then followed by a compression phase towards the end of training with dimensionality decrease, suggesting a refinement into more compact representations.

They are key contributors to the growing antibiotic resistance crisis and account for two-thirds of all infections. Thus, there is a critical need to develop anti-biofilm specific therapeutics. Here we discuss mechanisms of biofilm formation, current anti-biofilm agents, and strategies for developing, discovering, and testing new anti-biofilm agents. Biofilm formation involves many factors and is broadly regulated by the stringent response, quorum sensing, and c-di-GMP signaling, processes that have been targeted by anti-biofilm agents. Developing new anti-biofilm agents requires a comprehensive systems-level understanding of these mechanisms, as well as the discovery of new mechanisms. This can be accomplished through omics approaches such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, which can also be integrated to better understand biofilm biology. Guided by mechanistic understanding, in silico techniques such as virtual screening and machine learning can discover small molecules that can inhibit key biofilm regulators. To increase the likelihood that these candidate agents selected from in silico approaches are efficacious in humans, they must be tested in biologically relevant biofilm models. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of in vitro and in vivo biofilm models and highlight organoids as a new biofilm model. This review offers a comprehensive guide of current and future biological and computational approaches of anti-biofilm therapeutic discovery for investigators to utilize to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis.},

Here we study the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of data-representations, i.e. the minimal number of parameters needed to describe a representation. We find that, in a trained network, the ID is orders of magnitude smaller than the number of units in each layer. Across layers, the ID first increases and then progressively decreases in the final layers. Remarkably, the ID of the last hidden layer predicts classification accuracy on the test set. These results can neither be found by linear dimensionality estimates (e.g., with principal component analysis), nor in representations that had been artificially linearized. They are neither found in untrained networks, nor in networks that are trained on randomized labels. This suggests that neural networks that can generalize are those that transform the data into low-dimensional, but not necessarily flat manifolds.},

In this work, we aim to model the dynamics of resting-state (fMRI) and characterize the dynamical patterns in resting-state (fMRI) time series data in left and right hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus. We use Sliding Window Embedding (SWE) method to reconstruct the phase space of resting-state (fMRI) data from left and right hippocampus and orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus. The complexity of resting-state MRI data is examined using fractal analysis. The main purpose of the current study is to explore the topological organization of hippocampus and frontal gyrus and consequently, memory. By constructing resting-state functional network from resting-state (fMRI) time series data, we are able to draw a big picture of how brain functions and step forward to classify brain activity between normal control people and patients with different brain disorders.},

The contrasting Hopfieldian view explains cognition as the result of transformations between or movement within representational spaces that are implemented by neural populations. Thus, the Hopfieldian view relegates details regarding the identity of and connections between specific neurons to the status of secondary explainers. Only the Hopfieldian approach has the representational and computational resources needed to develop novel neurofunctional objects that can serve as primary explainers of cognition.},

The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.},

Here, we organize different definitions of scale-free networks and construct a severe test of their empirical prevalence using state-of-the-art statistical tools applied to nearly 1000 social, biological, technological, transportation, and information networks. Across these networks, we find robust evidence that strongly scale-free structure is empirically rare, while for most networks, log-normal distributions fit the data as well or better than power laws. Furthermore, social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks appear strongly scale free. These findings highlight the structural diversity of real-world networks and the need for new theoretical explanations of these non-scale-free patterns.},

To this end, hyperbolic geometry provides deep RL models with a natural basis to precisely encode this inherently hierarchical information. However, applying existing methodologies from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal optimization instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance characterizing RL gradient estimators. Hence, we design a new general method that counteracts such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end learning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our framework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on the Procgen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and generalization benefits.

  abstract = {Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly compared to simple heuristics on Link Prediction (LP) tasks. This is due to limitations in expressive power such as the inability to count triangles (the backbone of most LP heuristics) and because they can not distinguish automorphic nodes (those having identical structural roles). Both expressiveness issues can be alleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and incorporating structural features such as triangle counts. Since explicit link representations are often prohibitively expensive, recent works resorted to subgraph-based methods, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance for LP, but suffer from poor efficiency due to high levels of redundancy between subgraphs. We analyze the components of subgraph GNN (SGNN) methods for link prediction. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel full-graph GNN called ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as messages to approximate the key components of SGNNs without explicit subgraph construction. ELPH is provably more expressive than Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs). It outperforms existing SGNN models on many standard LP benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster. However, it shares the common GNN limitation that it is only efficient when the dataset fits in GPU memory. Accordingly, we develop a highly scalable model, called BUDDY, which uses feature precomputation to circumvent this limitation without sacrificing predictive performance. Our experiments show that BUDDY also outperforms SGNNs on standard LP benchmarks while being highly scalable and faster than ELPH.},

To this end, it is crucial to find a true representation of the neural data, which is challenging due to the high complexity of behaviors and the low signal-to-ratio (SNR) of the signals. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework, Neural Latent Aligner (NLA), to find well-constrained, behaviorally relevant neural representations of complex behaviors. The key idea is to align representations across repeated trials to learn cross-trial consistent information. Furthermore, we propose a novel, fully differentiable time warping model (TWM) to resolve the temporal misalignment of trials. When applied to intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) of natural speaking, our model learns better representations for decoding behaviors than the baseline models, especially in lower dimensional space. The TWM is empirically validated by measuring behavioral coherence between aligned trials. The proposed framework learns more cross-trial consistent representations than the baselines, and when visualized, the manifold reveals shared neural trajectories across trials.},

The astonishing insight of chaos theory is that such unpredictable patterns can, in principle, arise without the need for any random processes, i.e., purely deterministically without noise. However, while chaos is well understood in mathematics and physics, its role in cell biology remains unclear because the complexity and noisiness of biological systems make testing difficult. Here, we show that chaos explains the heterogeneous response of Escherichia coli cells to oxidative stress. We developed a theoretical model of the gene expression dynamics and demonstrate that chaotic behavior arises from rapid molecular feedbacks that are coupled with cell growth dynamics and cell-cell interactions. Based on theoretical predictions, we then designed single-cell experiments to show we can shift gene expression from periodic oscillations to chaos on demand. Our work suggests that chaotic gene regulation can be employed by cell populations to generate strong and variable responses to changing environments.},

The key idea is to generate features from a trained autoencoder to create novel encoding models that successfully model brain activity. As a proof of concept, we applied this method to fMRI data acquired from three participants who performed a taxi-driver task in a large virtual environment. A spatiotemporal variational autoencoder was trained on the visual stimulus seen by the participants while they performed the task, and ridge regression was used to estimate voxelwise encoding models based on the latent features learned by the autoencoder. Inspection of the fit voxelwise encoding models shows that the latent autoencoder features explain variance in brain activity broadly across the cerebral cortex. To interpret the fit encoding models a new cluster analysis method called model connectivity (MC) was used to recover functional networks by grouping voxels according to their encoding model weights. MC recovers several different networks from the data, encompassing motor (M1 and S1), vision (V1-4), navigation (RSC, OPA, PPA, and PFC), and theory-of-mind (TPJ and PFC) ROIs and other regions of the cerebral cortex. Finally, to facilitate interpretation the average weights obtained within each identified cluster were decoded. This procedure revealed specific visual-motor features--such as approaching vehicles and destination instructions--that are preferentially represented in distinct functional networks. In sum, these preliminary data suggest that a variational autoencoder can reveal novel aspects of cortical representation during naturalistic navigation.},

In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for studying the space of hypergraphs using ingredients from optimal transport. By enriching a hypergraph with probability measures on its nodes and hyperedges, as well as relational information capturing local and global structures, we obtain a general and robust framework for studying the collection of all hypergraphs. First, we introduce a hypergraph distance based on the co-optimal transport framework of Redko et al. and study its theoretical properties. Second, we formalize common methods for transforming a hypergraph into a graph as maps between the space of hypergraphs and the space of graphs, and study their functorial properties and Lipschitz bounds. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our Hypergraph Co-Optimal Transport (HyperCOT) framework through various examples.},

At the same time, advances in machine learning have unleashed the remarkable computational power of artificial neural networks (ANNs). While these two fields have different tools and applications, they present a similar challenge: namely, understanding how information is embedded and processed through high-dimensional representations to solve complex tasks. One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilize mathematical and computational tools to analyze the geometry of these high-dimensional representations, i.e., neural population geometry. We review examples of geometrical approaches providing insight into the function of biological and artificial neural networks: representation untangling in perception, a geometric theory of classification capacity, disentanglement and abstraction in cognitive systems, topological representations underlying cognitive maps, dynamic untangling in motor systems, and a dynamical approach to cognition. Together, these findings illustrate an exciting trend at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and geometry, in which neural population geometry provides a useful population-level mechanistic descriptor underlying task implementation. Importantly, geometric descriptions are applicable across sensory modalities, brain regions, network architectures and timescales. Thus, neural population geometry has the potential to unify our understanding of structure and function in biological and artificial neural networks, bridging the gap between single neurons, populations and behavior.},

It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80\% longer than RNNs and 450\% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning).

  abstract = {Comparing learned neural representations in neural networks is a challenging but important problem, which has been approached in different ways. The Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity metric, particularly its linear variant, has recently become a popular approach and has been widely used to compare representations of a network's different layers, of architecturally similar networks trained differently, or of models with different architectures trained on the same data. A wide variety of claims about similarity and dissimilarity of these various representations have been made using CKA results. In this work we present analysis that formally characterizes CKA sensitivity to a large class of simple transformations, which can naturally occur in the context of modern machine learning. This provides a concrete explanation to CKA sensitivity to outliers, which has been observed in past works, and to transformations that preserve the linear separability of the data, an important generalization attribute. We empirically investigate several weaknesses of the CKA similarity metric, demonstrating situations in which it gives unexpected or counterintuitive results. Finally we study approaches for modifying representations to maintain functional behaviour while changing the CKA value. Our results illustrate that, in many cases, the CKA value can be easily manipulated without substantial changes to the functional behaviour of the models, and call for caution when leveraging activation alignment metrics.},

We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths. The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for data stream manipulation, aligning LLM outputs with user objectives. As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models endowed with zero- and few-shot learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addressing specific problems. In turn, the framework facilitates the creation and evaluation of explainable computational graphs. We conclude by introducing a quality measure and its empirical score for evaluating these computational graphs, and propose a benchmark that compares various state-of-the-art LLMs across a set of complex workflows. We refer to the empirical score as the "Vector Embedding for Relational Trajectory Evaluation through Cross-similarity", or VERTEX score for short.

In this Perspective article, we propose that arguing about the successes and failures of a restricted set of current ANNs is the wrong approach to assess the promise of neuroconnectionism for brain science. Instead, we take inspiration from the philosophy of science, and in particular from Lakatos, who showed that the core of a~scientific research programme is often not directly falsifiable but should be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights. Following this view, we present neuroconnectionism as a general research programme centred around ANNs as a computational language for expressing falsifiable theories about brain computation. We describe the core of the programme, the underlying computational framework and its tools for testing specific neuroscientific hypotheses and deriving novel understanding. Taking a longitudinal view, we review past and present neuroconnectionist projects and their responses to challenges and argue that the research programme is highly progressive, generating new and otherwise unreachable insights into the workings of the brain.},

For example, 2D space obeys rules: the same set of actions combine in the same way everywhere (step north, then south, and you won't have moved, wherever you start). We suggest the brain must represent this consistent meaning of actions across space, as it allows you to find new short-cuts and navigate in unfamiliar settings. We term this representation an `actionable representation'. We formulate actionable representations using group and representation theory, and show that, when combined with biological and functional constraints - non-negative firing, bounded neural activity, and precise coding - multiple modules of hexagonal grid cells are the optimal representation of 2D space. We support this claim with intuition, analytic justification, and simulations. Our analytic results normatively explain a set of surprising grid cell phenomena, and make testable predictions for future experiments. Lastly, we highlight the generality of our approach beyond just understanding 2D space. Our work characterises a new principle for understanding and designing flexible internal representations: they should be actionable, allowing animals and machines to predict the consequences of their actions, rather than just encode.},

Existing methods compare deterministic responses (e.g. artificial networks that lack stochastic layers) or averaged responses (e.g., trial-averaged firing rates in biological data). However, these measures of \_deterministic\_ representational similarity ignore the scale and geometric structure of noise, both of which play important roles in neural computation. To rectify this, we generalize previously proposed shape metrics (Williams et al. 2021) to quantify differences in \_stochastic\_ representations. These new distances satisfy the triangle inequality, and thus can be used as a rigorous basis for many supervised and unsupervised analyses. Leveraging this novel framework, we find that the stochastic geometries of neurobiological representations of oriented visual gratings and naturalistic scenes respectively resemble untrained and trained deep network representations. Further, we are able to more accurately predict certain network attributes (e.g. training hyperparameters) from its position in stochastic (versus deterministic) shape space.},

  abstract = {Microbial community structure is influenced by the environment and in turn exerts control on many environmental parameters. We applied this concept in a bioreactor study to test whether microbial community structure contains information sufficient to predict the concentration of H2S as the product of sulfate reduction. Microbial sulfate reduction is a major source of H2S in many industrial and environmental systems and is often influenced by the existing physicochemical conditions. Production of H2S in industrial systems leads to occupational hazards and adversely affects the quality of products. A long-term (148\,days) experiment was conducted in upflow bioreactors to mimic sulfidogenesis, followed by inhibition with nitrate salts and a resumption of H2S generation when inhibition was released. We determined microbial community structure in 731 samples across 20 bioreactors using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and applied a random forest algorithm to successfully predict different phases of sulfidogenesis and mitigation (accuracy\,=\,93.17\%) and sessile and effluent microbial communities (accuracy\,=\,100\%). Similarly derived regression models that also included cell abundances were able to predict H2S concentration with remarkably high fidelity (R2 {$>$} 0.82). Metabolic profiles based on microbial community structure were also found to be reliable predictors for H2S concentration (R2 = 0.78). These results suggest that microbial community structure contains information sufficient to predict sulfidogenesis in a closed system, with anticipated applications to microbially driven processes in open environments. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities control many biogeochemical processes. Many of these processes are impractical or expensive to measure directly. Because the taxonomic structure of the microbial community is indicative of its function, it encodes information that can be used to predict biogeochemistry. Here, we demonstrate how a machine learning technique can be used to predict sulfidogenesis, a key biogeochemical process in a model system. A distinction of this research was the ability to predict H2S production in a bioreactor from the effluent bacterial community structure without direct observations of the sessile community or other environmental conditions. This study establishes the ability to use machine learning approaches in predicting sulfide concentrations in a closed system, which can be further developed as a valuable tool for predicting biogeochemical processes in open environments. As machine learning algorithms continue to improve, we anticipate increased applications of microbial community structure to predict key environmental and industrial processes.},

Despite their staggering success, a critical issue has been the enormous number of parameters that must be trained (ranging from \$10\^{}7\$ to \$10\^{}\{11\}\$) along with the quadratic complexity of dot-product attention. In this work, we investigate the problem of approximating the two central components of the Transformer -- multi-head self-attention and point-wise feed-forward transformation, with reduced parameter space and computational complexity. We build upon recent developments in analyzing deep neural networks as numerical solvers of ordinary differential equations. Taking advantage of an analogy between Transformer stages and the evolution of a dynamical system of multiple interacting particles, we formulate a temporal evolution scheme, TransEvolve, to bypass costly dot-product attention over multiple stacked layers. We perform exhaustive experiments with TransEvolve on well-known encoder-decoder as well as encoder-only tasks. We observe that the degree of approximation (or inversely, the degree of parameter reduction) has different effects on the performance, depending on the task. While in the encoder-decoder regime, TransEvolve delivers performances comparable to the original Transformer, in encoder-only tasks it consistently outperforms Transformer along with several subsequent variants.},

  abstract = {Recent AI research has emphasised the importance of learning disentangled representations of the explanatory factors behind data. Despite the growing interest in models which can learn such representations, visual inspection remains the standard evaluation metric. While various desiderata have been implied in recent definitions, it is currently unclear what exactly makes one disentangled representation better than another. In this work we propose a framework for the quantitative evaluation of disentangled representations when the ground-truth latent structure is available. Three criteria are explicitly defined and quantified to elucidate the quality of learnt representations and thus compare models on an equal basis. To illustrate the appropriateness of the framework, we employ it to compare quantitatively the representations learned by recent state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract = {Advanced perceptual systems are faced with the problem of securing a principled (ideally, veridical) relationship between the world and its internal representation. I propose a unified approach to visual representation, addressing the need for superordinate and basic-level categorization and for the identification of specific instances of familiar categories. According to the proposed theory, a shape is represented internally by the responses of a small number of tuned modules, each broadly selective for some reference shape, whose similarity to the stimulus it measures. This amounts to embedding the stimulus in a low-dimensional proximal shape space spanned by the outputs of the active modules. This shape space supports representations of distal shape similarities that are veridical as Shepard's (1968) second-order isomorphisms (i.e., correspondence between distal and proximal similarities among shapes, rather than between distal shapes and their proximal representations). Representation in terms of similarities to reference shapes supports processing (e.g., discrimination) of shapes that are radically different from the reference ones, without the need for the computationally problematic decomposition into parts required by other theories. Furthermore, a general expression for similarity between two stimuli, based on comparisons to reference shapes, can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging from continuous, symmetric, and hierarchical ones, as in multidimensional scaling (Shepard 1980), to discrete and nonhierarchical ones, as in the general contrast models (Shepard \& Arabie 1979; Tversky 1977).},

  abstract = {Lesion inference analysis is a fundamental approach for characterizing the causal contributions of neural elements to brain function. This approach has gained new prominence through the arrival of modern perturbation techniques with unprecedented levels of spatiotemporal precision. While inferences drawn from brain perturbations are conceptually powerful, they face methodological difficulties. Particularly, they are challenged to disentangle the true causal contributions of the involved elements, since often functions arise from coalitions of distributed, interacting elements, and localized perturbations have unknown global consequences. To elucidate these limitations, we systematically and exhaustively lesioned a small artificial neural network (ANN) playing a classic arcade game. We determined the functional contributions of all nodes and links, contrasting results from sequential single-element perturbations with simultaneous perturbations of multiple elements. We found that lesioning individual elements, one at a time, produced biased results. By contrast, multi-site lesion analysis captured crucial details that were missed by single-site lesions. We conclude that even small and seemingly simple ANNs show surprising complexity that needs to be addressed by multi-lesioning for a coherent causal characterization.},

  abstract = {Distinct brain and behavioural states are associated with organized neural population dynamics that are thought to serve specific cognitive functions1--3. Memory replay events, for example, occur during synchronous population events called sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus while mice are in an `offline' behavioural state, enabling cognitive mechanisms such as memory consolidation and planning4--11. But how does the brain re-engage with the external world during this behavioural state and permit access to current sensory information or promote new memory formation? Here we found that the hippocampal dentate spike, an understudied population event that frequently occurs between sharp-wave ripples12, may underlie such a mechanism. We show that dentate spikes are associated with distinctly elevated brain-wide firing rates, primarily observed in higher order networks, and couple to brief periods of arousal. Hippocampal place coding during dentate spikes aligns to the mouse's current spatial location, unlike the memory replay accompanying sharp-wave ripples. Furthermore, inhibiting neural activity during dentate spikes disrupts associative memory formation. Thus, dentate spikes represent a distinct brain state and support memory during non-locomotor behaviour, extending the repertoire of cognitive processes beyond the classical offline functions.},

  abstract = {Pang et al. (2023) present novel analyses demonstrating that brain dynamics can be understood as resulting from the excitation of geometric modes, derived from the shape of the brain. Notably, they demonstrate that linear combinations of geometric modes can reconstruct patterns of fMRI data more accurately, and with fewer dimensions, than comparable connectivity-derived modes. Equipped with these results, and underpinned by neural field theory, the authors contend that the geometry of the cortical surface provides a more parsimonious explanation of brain activity than structural brain connectivity. This claim runs counter to prevailing theories of information flow in the brain, which emphasize the role of long-distance axonal projections and fasciculated white matter in relaying signals between cortical regions (Honey et al. 2009; Deco et al. 2011; Seguin et al., 2023). While we acknowledge that cortical geometry plays an important role in shaping human brain function, we feel that the presented work falls short of establishing that the brain's geometry is ``a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity'' (Pang et al. 2023). Here, we provide 1) a brief critique of the paper's framing and 2) evidence showing that their methodology lacks specificity to the brain's orientation and shape. Ultimately, we recognize that the geometric mode approach is a powerful representational framework for brain dynamics analysis, but we also believe that there are key caveats to consider alongside the claims made in the manuscript.},

  abstract = {Dynamical models underpin our ability to understand and predict the behaviour of natural systems. Whether dynamical models are developed from first-principles derivations or from observational data, they are predicated on our choice of state variables. The choice of state variables is driven by convenience and intuition, and, in data-driven cases, the observed variables are often chosen to be the state variables. The dimensionality of these variables (and consequently the dynamical models) can be arbitrarily large, obscuring the underlying behaviour of the system. In truth these variables are often highly redundant and the system is driven by a much smaller set of latent intrinsic variables. In this study we combine the mathematical theory of manifolds with the representational capacity of neural networks to develop a method that learns a system's intrinsic state variables directly from time-series data, as well as predictive models for their dynamics. What distinguishes our method is its ability to reduce data to the intrinsic dimensionality of the nonlinear manifold they live on. This ability is enabled by the concepts of charts and atlases from the theory of manifolds, whereby a manifold is represented by a collection of patches that are sewn together---a necessary representation to attain intrinsic dimensionality. We demonstrate this approach on several high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behaviour. The resulting framework provides the ability to develop dynamical models of the lowest possible dimension, capturing the essence of a system.},

Prior work has established the cluster assumption{\textbackslash},---{\textbackslash},under which the data distribution consists of uniform class clusters of samples separated by low density regions{\textbackslash},---{\textbackslash},as key to its success. We analyze the problem of semantic segmentation and find that the data distribution does not exhibit low density regions separating classes and offer this as an explanation for why semi-supervised segmentation is a challenging problem. We then identify the conditions that allow consistency regularization to work even without such low-density regions. This allows us to generalize the recently proposed CutMix augmentation technique to a powerful masked variant, CowMix, leading to a successful application of consistency regularization in the semi-supervised semantic segmentation setting and reaching state-of-the-art results in several standard datasets.},

We show that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches with respect to goodness of fit, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that veloVI's posterior velocity uncertainty can be used to assess whether velocity analysis is appropriate for a given dataset. Finally, we highlight veloVI as a flexible framework for modeling transcriptional dynamics by adapting the underlying dynamical model to use time-dependent transcription rates.},

Because human category reports (aka human percepts) are thought to be insensitive to those same small-norm perturbations -- and locally stable in general -- this argues that ANNs are incomplete scientific models of human visual perception. Consistent with this, we show that when small-norm image perturbations are generated by standard ANN models, human object category percepts are indeed highly stable. However, in this very same "human-presumed-stable" regime, we find that robustified ANNs reliably discover low-norm image perturbations that strongly disrupt human percepts. These previously undetectable human perceptual disruptions are massive in amplitude, approaching the same level of sensitivity seen in robustified ANNs. Further, we show that robustified ANNs support precise perceptual state interventions: they guide the construction of low-norm image perturbations that strongly alter human category percepts toward specific prescribed percepts. These observations suggest that for arbitrary starting points in image space, there exists a set of nearby "wormholes", each leading the subject from their current category perceptual state into a semantically very different state. Moreover, contemporary ANN models of biological visual processing are now accurate enough to consistently guide us to those portals.},

In reinforcement learning, effective and functional representations have the potential to tremendously accelerate learning progress and solve more challenging problems. Most prior work on representation learning has focused on generative approaches, learning representations that capture all underlying factors of variation in the observation space in a more disentangled or well-ordered manner. In this paper, we instead aim to learn functionally salient representations: representations that are not necessarily complete in terms of capturing all factors of variation in the observation space, but rather aim to capture those factors of variation that are important for decision making -- that are "actionable." These representations are aware of the dynamics of the environment, and capture only the elements of the observation that are necessary for decision making rather than all factors of variation, without explicit reconstruction of the observation. We show how these representations can be useful to improve exploration for sparse reward problems, to enable long horizon hierarchical reinforcement learning, and as a state representation for learning policies for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on a number of simulated environments, and compare it to prior methods for representation learning, exploration, and hierarchical reinforcement learning.},

Here, we study the opposite limit, in which hidden governing coordinates must be inferred from only a low-dimensional time series of measurements. Inspired by classical analysis techniques for partial observations of chaotic attractors, we introduce a general embedding technique for univariate and multivariate time series, consisting of an autoencoder trained with a novel latent-space loss function. We show that our technique reconstructs the strange attractors of synthetic and real-world systems better than existing techniques, and that it creates consistent, predictive representations of even stochastic systems.

Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.},

  abstract = {Various artificial neural networks developed by engineers have been evaluated as models of the brain, such as the ventral stream in the primate visual cortex. After being trained on large datasets, the network outputs are compared to recordings of biological neurons. Good performance in reproducing neural responses is taken as validation for the model. This system identification approach is different from the traditional ways to test theories and associated models in the natural sciences. Furthermore, it lacks a clear foundation in terms of theory and empirical validation. Here we begin characterizing some of these emerging approaches: what do they tell us? To address this question, we benchmark their ability to correctly identify a model by replacing the brain recordings with recordings from a known ground truth model. We evaluate commonly used identification techniques such as neural regression (linear regression on a population of model units) and centered kernel alignment (CKA). Even in the setting where the correct model is among the candidates, we find that the performance of these approaches at system identification is quite variable; it also depends significantly on factors independent of the ground truth architecture, such as scoring function and dataset.},

  abstract = {The meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework, which involves RL over multiple timescales, has been successful in training deep RL models that generalize to new environments. It has been hypothesized that the prefrontal cortex may mediate meta-RL in the brain, but the evidence is scarce. Here we show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) mediates meta-RL. We trained mice and deep RL models on a probabilistic reversal learning task across sessions during which they improved their trial-by-trial RL policy through meta-learning. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent synaptic plasticity in OFC was necessary for this meta-learning but not for the within-session trial-by-trial RL in experts. After meta-learning, OFC activity robustly encoded value signals, and OFC inactivation impaired the RL behaviors. Longitudinal tracking of OFC activity revealed that meta-learning gradually shapes population value coding to guide the ongoing behavioral policy. Our results indicate that two distinct RL algorithms with distinct neural mechanisms and timescales coexist in OFC to support adaptive decision-making.},

  abstract = {A common assumption in many domains is that high dimensional data are a smooth nonlinear function of a small number of independent factors. When is it possible to recover the factors from unlabeled data? In the context of deep models this problem is called ``disentanglement'' and was recently shown to be impossible without additional strong assumptions [17, 19]. In this paper, we show that the assumption of local isometry together with non-Gaussianity of the factors, is sufficient to provably recover disentangled representations from data. We leverage recent advances in deep generative models to construct manifolds of highly realistic images for which the ground truth latent representation is known, and test whether modern and classical methods succeed in recovering the latent factors. For many different manifolds, we find that a spectral method that explicitly optimizes local isometry and non-Gaussianity consistently finds the correct latent factors, while baseline deep autoencoders do not. We propose how to encourage deep autoencoders to find encodings that satisfy local isometry and show that this helps them discover disentangled representations. Overall, our results suggest that in some realistic settings, unsupervised disentanglement is provably possible, without any domain-specific assumptions.},

We propose utilizing a 3D hyperbolic variational autoencoder with a novel gyroplane convolutional layer to map from the embedding space back to 3D images. To capture these relationships, we introduce an essential self-supervised loss -- in addition to the standard VAE loss -- which infers approximate hierarchies and encourages implicitly related subvolumes to be mapped closer in the embedding space.

If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety.},

Often, patterns in such data evolve over time among multiple dimensions and are hard to detect. Dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and MDS allow analysis and visualization of multivariate data, but per se do not provide means to explore multivariate patterns over time. We propose Temporal Multidimensional Scaling (TMDS), a novel visualization technique that computes temporal one-dimensional MDS plots for multivariate data which evolve over time. Using a sliding window approach, MDS is computed for each data window separately, and the results are plotted sequentially along the time axis, taking care of plot alignment. Our TMDS plots enable visual identification of patterns based on multidimensional similarity of the data evolving over time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of network security and show in two case studies how users can iteratively explore the data to identify previously unknown, temporally evolving patterns.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.},

These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.},

  abstract = {Graph representation learning aims to effectively encode high-dimensional sparse graph-structured data into low-dimensional dense vectors, which is a fundamental task that has been widely studied in a range of fields, including machine learning and data mining. Classic graph embedding methods follow the basic idea that the embedding vectors of interconnected nodes in the graph can still maintain a relatively close distance, thereby preserving the structural information between the nodes in the graph. However, this is sub-optimal due to: (i) traditional methods have limited model capacity which limits the learning performance; (ii) existing techniques typically rely on unsupervised learning strategies and fail to couple with the latest learning paradigms; (iii) representation learning and downstream tasks are dependent on each other which should be jointly enhanced. With the remarkable success of deep learning, deep graph representation learning has shown great potential and advantages over shallow (traditional) methods, there exist a large number of deep graph representation learning techniques have been proposed in the past decade, especially graph neural networks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive survey on current deep graph representation learning algorithms by proposing a new taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art literature. Specifically, we systematically summarize the essential components of graph representation learning and categorize existing approaches by the ways of graph neural network architectures and the most recent advanced learning paradigms. Moreover, this survey also provides the practical and promising applications of deep graph representation learning.

Representation similarity measures have emerged as a popular tool for examining learned representations However, existing measures only provide aggregate estimates of similarity at a global level, i.e. over a set of representations for N input examples. As such, these measures are not well-suited for investigating representations at a local level, i.e. representations of a single input example. Local similarity measures are needed, for instance, to understand which individual input representations are affected by training interventions to models (e.g. to be more fair and unbiased) or are at greater risk of being misclassified. In this work, we fill in this gap and propose Pointwise Normalized Kernel Alignment (PNKA), a measure that quantifies how similarly an individual input is represented in two representation spaces. Intuitively, PNKA compares the similarity of an input's neighborhoods across both spaces. Using our measure, we are able to analyze properties of learned representations at a finer granularity than what was previously possible. Concretely, we show how PNKA can be leveraged to develop a deeper understanding of (a) the input examples that are likely to be misclassified, (b) the concepts encoded by (individual) neurons in a layer, and (c) the effects of fairness interventions on learned representations.},

We introduce a similarity index that measures the relationship between representational similarity matrices and does not suffer from this limitation.

  abstract = {The pairwise dissimilarities of a set of items can be intuitively visualized by a 2D arrangement of the items, in which the distances reflect the dissimilarities. Such an arrangement can be obtained by multidimensional scaling (MDS). We propose a method for the inverse process: inferring the pairwise dissimilarities from multiple 2D arrangements of items. Perceptual dissimilarities are classically measured using pairwise dissimilarity judgments. However, alternative methods including free sorting and 2D arrangements have previously been proposed. The present proposal is novel (a) in that the dissimilarity matrix is estimated by ``inverse MDS'' based on multiple arrangements of item subsets, and (b) in that the subsets are designed by an adaptive algorithm that aims to provide optimal evidence for the dissimilarity estimates. The subject arranges the items (represented as icons on a computer screen) by means of mouse drag-and-drop operations. The multi-arrangement method can be construed as a generalization of simpler methods: It reduces to pairwise dissimilarity judgments if each arrangement contains only two items, and to free sorting if the items are categorically arranged into discrete piles. Multi-arrangement combines the advantages of these methods. It is efficient (because the subject communicates many dissimilarity judgments with each mouse drag), psychologically attractive (because dissimilarities are judged in context), and can characterize continuous high-dimensional dissimilarity structures. We present two procedures for estimating the dissimilarity matrix: a simple weighted-aligned-average of the partial dissimilarity matrices and a computationally intensive algorithm, which estimates the dissimilarity matrix by iteratively minimizing the error of MDS-predictions of the subject's arrangements. The Matlab code for interactive arrangement and dissimilarity estimation is available from the authors upon request.},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.},

Conversely, we show that if a network has some metric structure, and if the network degree distribution is heterogeneous, then the network has an effective hyperbolic geometry underneath. We then establish a mapping between our geometric framework and statistical mechanics of complex networks. This mapping interprets edges in a network as noninteracting fermions whose energies are hyperbolic distances between nodes, while the auxiliary fields coupled to edges are linear functions of these energies or distances. The geometric network ensemble subsumes the standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures. Finally, we show that targeted transport processes without global topology knowledge, made possible by our geometric framework, are maximally efficient, according to all efficiency measures, in networks with strongest heterogeneity and clustering, and that this efficiency is remarkably robust with respect to even catastrophic disturbances and damages to the network structure.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Deep artificial neural networks with spatially repeated processing (a.k.a., deep convolutional ANNs) have been established as the best class of candidate models of visual processing in primate ventral visual processing stream. Over the past five years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple feedforward eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching NAS-Net architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance and increasingly better explanatory power of both neural and behavioral responses. However, from the neuroscientist's point of view, the relationship between such very deep architectures and the ventral visual pathway is incomplete in at least two ways. On the one hand, current state-of-the-art ANNs appear to be too complex (e.g., now over 100 levels) compared with the relatively shallow cortical hierarchy (4-8 levels), which makes it difficult to map their elements to those in the ventral visual stream and to understand what they are doing. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art ANNs appear to be not complex enough in that they lack recurrent connections and the resulting neural response dynamics that are commonplace in the ventral visual stream. Here we describe our ongoing efforts to resolve both of these issues by developing a ``CORnet'' family of deep neural network architectures. Rather than just seeking high object recognition performance (as the state-of-the-art ANNs above), we instead try to reduce the model family to its most important elements and then gradually build new ANNs with recurrent and skip connections while monitoring both performance and the match between each new CORnet model and a large body of primate brain and behavioral data. We report here that our current best ANN model derived from this approach (CORnet-S) is among the top models on Brain-Score, a composite benchmark for comparing models to the brain, but is simpler than other deep ANNs in terms of the number of convolutions performed along the longest path of information processing in the model. All CORnet models are available at github.com/dicarlolab/CORnet, and we plan to up-date this manuscript and the available models in this family as they are produced.},

However, concrete methodologies for bridging the gap between these levels of abstraction remain elusive. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms of neural networks through the lens of neural population geometry, aiming to provide understanding at an intermediate level of abstraction, as a way to bridge that gap. Utilizing manifold capacity theory (MCT) from statistical physics and manifold alignment analysis (MAA) from high-dimensional statistics, we probe the underlying organization of task-dependent manifolds in deep neural networks and macaque neural recordings. Specifically, we quantitatively characterize how different learning objectives lead to differences in the organizational strategies of these models and demonstrate how these geometric analyses are connected to the decodability of task-relevant information. These analyses present a strong direction for bridging mechanistic and normative theories in neural networks through neural population geometry, potentially opening up many future research avenues in both machine learning and neuroscience.},

However, previous neuroscientific investigations of face and voice recognition have tended to measure identity-related responses and representations using tightly controlled stimuli, thus under sampling the naturalistic variability encountered in everyday life. In this study, we tested whether cortical regions previously implicated in processing faces and voices represent identities during naturalistic and task-free stimulation. Representational similarity analyses were conducted on functional MRI datasets collected while human participants watched feature-length movies. Identity representations---defined as similar response patterns to variable instances of the same person (``telling together''), and dissimilar patterns in response to different people (``telling apart'')---were observed in established face and voice processing areas, across two independent participant groups viewing different sets of identities. We also explored contributions of face versus voice information to identity representations, finding more widespread preferential sensitivity to faces. We thus characterise how the brain represents identities in the real world, for the first-time accounting for both ``telling people together'' and ``telling people apart.'' Despite substantial differences to previous experimental research, our findings align with previous work, showing that similar brain areas are engaged in the representation of identities under experimental and naturalistic exposure.},

A fundamental problem for systems neuroscience is determining the best way to relate structural and functional networks quantified by diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI. As one of the state-of-the-art approaches for network analysis, graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been separately used to analyze functional and structural networks, but have not been applied to explore inter-network relationships. In this work, we propose to couple the two networks of an individual by adding inter-network edges between corresponding brain regions, so that the joint structure-function graph can be directly analyzed by a single GCN. The weights of inter-network edges are learnable, reflecting non-uniform structure-function coupling strength across the brain. We apply our Joint-GCN to predict age and sex of 662 participants from the public dataset of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) based on their functional and micro-structural white-matter networks. Our results support that the proposed Joint-GCN outperforms existing multi-modal graph learning approaches for analyzing structural and functional networks.},

  abstract = {A central question for neuroscience is how to characterize brain representations of perceptual and cognitive content. An ideal characterization should distinguish different functional regions with robustness to noise and idiosyncrasies of individual brains that do not correspond to computational differences. Previous studies have characterized brain representations by their representational geometry, which is defined by the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), a summary statistic that abstracts from the roles of individual neurons (or responses channels) and characterizes the discriminability of stimuli. Here we explore a further step of abstraction: from the geometry to the topology of brain representations. We propose topological representational similarity analysis (tRSA), an extension of representational similarity analysis (RSA) that uses a family of geo-topological summary statistics that generalizes the RDM to characterize the topology while de-emphasizing the geometry. We evaluate this new family of statistics in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for model selection using both simulations and functional MRI (fMRI) data. In the simulations, the ground truth is a data-generating layer representation in a neural network model and the models are the same and other layers in different model instances (trained from different random seeds). In fMRI, the ground truth is a visual area and the models are the same and other areas measured in different subjects. Results show that topology-sensitive characterizations of population codes are robust to noise and interindividual variability and maintain excellent sensitivity to the unique representational signatures of different neural network layers and brain regions.},

Most existing approaches encode images and videos into separate feature spaces, which are then fed as inputs to large language models. However, due to the lack of unified tokenization for images and videos, namely misalignment before projection, it becomes challenging for a Large Language Model (LLM) to learn multi-modal interactions from several poor projection layers. In this work, we unify visual representation into the language feature space to advance the foundational LLM towards a unified LVLM. As a result, we establish a simple but robust LVLM baseline, Video-LLaVA, which learns from a mixed dataset of images and videos, mutually enhancing each other. Video-LLaVA achieves superior performances on a broad range of 9 image benchmarks across 5 image question-answering datasets and 4 image benchmark toolkits. Additionally, our Video-LLaVA also outperforms Video-ChatGPT by 5.8\%, 9.9\%, 18.6\%, and 10.1\% on MSRVTT, MSVD, TGIF, and ActivityNet, respectively. Notably, extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-LLaVA mutually benefits images and videos within a unified visual representation, outperforming models designed specifically for images or videos. We aim for this work to provide modest insights into the multi-modal inputs for the LLM.},

DeepCAD-RT will facilitate the morphological and functional interrogation of biological dynamics with a minimal photon budget.},

SRDTrans can restore high-frequency information without producing oversmoothed structures and distorted fluorescence traces.

In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture for learning from time-varying data that builds descriptions of both the individual as well as the collective population dynamics. Rather than combining all of our data into our model at the onset, we develop a separable architecture that operates on individual time-series first before passing them forward; this induces a permutation-invariance property and can be used to transfer across systems of different size and order. After demonstrating that our model can be applied to successfully recover complex interactions and dynamics in many-body systems, we apply our approach to populations of neurons in the nervous system. On neural activity datasets, we show that our model not only yields robust decoding performance, but also provides impressive performance in transfer across recordings of different animals without any neuron-level correspondence. By enabling flexible pre-training that can be transferred to neural recordings of different size and order, our work provides a first step towards creating a foundation model for neural decoding.},

  abstract = {The key idea behind the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is that real-world data is generated by a few explanatory factors of variation which can be recovered by unsupervised learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a sober look at recent progress in the field and challenge some common assumptions. We first theoretically show that the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than \$12000\$ models covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties ``encouraged'' by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks. Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision, investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned representations, and consider a reproducible experimental setup covering several data sets.},

Unfortunately, the feature maps that encode a diffusion model's internal information are spread not only over layers of the network, but also over diffusion timesteps, making it challenging to extract useful descriptors. We propose Diffusion Hyperfeatures, a framework for consolidating multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps into per-pixel feature descriptors that can be used for downstream tasks. These descriptors can be extracted for both synthetic and real images using the generation and inversion processes. We evaluate the utility of our Diffusion Hyperfeatures on the task of semantic keypoint correspondence: our method achieves superior performance on the SPair-71k real image benchmark. We also demonstrate that our method is flexible and transferable: our feature aggregation network trained on the inversion features of real image pairs can be used on the generation features of synthetic image pairs with unseen objects and compositions.

  abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that flaws in machine learning (ML) algorithm validation are an underestimated global problem. In biomedical image analysis, chosen performance metrics often do not reflect the domain interest, and thus fail to adequately measure scientific progress and hinder translation of ML techniques into practice. To overcome this, we created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive framework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics. Developed by a large international consortium in a multistage Delphi process, it is based on the novel concept of a problem fingerprint---a structured representation of the given problem that captures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain interest to the properties of the target structure(s), dataset and algorithm output. On the basis of the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process of choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware of potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that can be interpreted as classification tasks at image, object or pixel level, namely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the framework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool. Following the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics Reloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. Its applicability is demonstrated for various biomedical use cases.},

Similarly, classification is a central task in many machine learning applications, yet the problem of linear inseparability has long posed challenges for artificial neural networks since their inception. Here we asked how biological neural networks tackle this problem by investigating the geometric embedding of neural manifolds in macaques'V2 during orientation discrimination of motion-induced illusory contours. Specifically, we constructed a three-dimensional stimulus space that inherently made the orientation classification of these contours a linearly inseparable problem. As expected, we identified a sensory manifold, formed by the V2 neuron population, that faithfully corresponded to this stimulus space. Crucially, this sensory manifold underwent a series of twist operations, resulting in new axes orthogonal to the original ones. Within this expanded, high-dimensional perceptual manifold, the problem of linear inseparability became linearly separable. Computational models further revealed that the geometric twist operation was achieved by neurons exhibiting nonlinear mixed selectivity in networks with heterogeneous connectivity patterns. Taken together, our findings elucidate how perception arises from sensation through the lens of neural geometry, enriching our understanding of how cognitive functions derive from underlying anatomical structure.},

This paper proposes a spectral method for assessing and combining multiple visualizations of a given dataset produced by diverse algorithms. The proposed method provides a quantitative measure -- the visualization eigenscore -- of the relative performance of the visualizations for preserving the structure around each data point. It also generates a consensus visualization, having improved quality over individual visualizations in capturing the underlying structure. Our approach is flexible and works as a wrapper around any visualizations. We analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We also provide theoretical justifications based on a general statistical framework, yielding several fundamental principles along with practical guidance.},

  abstract = {A common motif in biology is the arrangement of cells into tubes, which further transform into complex shapes. Traditionally, analysis of dynamic tissues has relied on inspecting static snapshots, live imaging of cross-sections or tracking isolated cells in three dimensions. However, capturing the interplay between in-plane and out-of-plane behaviors requires following the full surface as it deforms and integrating cell-scale motions into collective, tissue-scale deformations. Here, we present an analysis framework that builds in toto maps of tissue deformations by following tissue parcels in a static material frame of reference. Our approach then relates in-plane and out-of-plane behaviors and decomposes complex deformation maps into elementary contributions. The tube-like surface Lagrangian analysis resource (TubULAR) provides an open-source implementation accessible either as a standalone toolkit or as an extension of the ImSAnE package used in the developmental biology community. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing shape change in the embryonic Drosophila midgut and beating zebrafish heart. The method naturally generalizes to in vitro and synthetic systems and provides ready access to the mechanical mechanisms relating genetic patterning to organ shape change.},

To develop our framework, we analyze existing definitions of AGI, and distill six principles that a useful ontology for AGI should satisfy. These principles include focusing on capabilities rather than mechanisms; separately evaluating generality and performance; and defining stages along the path toward AGI, rather than focusing on the endpoint. With these principles in mind, we propose 'Levels of AGI' based on depth (performance) and breadth (generality) of capabilities, and reflect on how current systems fit into this ontology. We discuss the challenging requirements for future benchmarks that quantify the behavior and capabilities of AGI models against these levels. Finally, we discuss how these levels of AGI interact with deployment considerations such as autonomy and risk, and emphasize the importance of carefully selecting Human-AI Interaction paradigms for responsible and safe deployment of highly capable AI systems.},

  abstract = {Neural networks embed the geometric structure of a data manifold lying in a high-dimensional space into latent representations. Ideally, the distribution of the data points in the latent space should depend only on the task, the data, the loss, and other architecture-specific constraints. However, factors such as the random weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless, we empirically observe that, under the same data and modeling choices, the angles between the encodings within distinct latent spaces do not change. In this work, we propose the latent similarity between each sample and a fixed set of anchors as an alternative data representation, demonstrating that it can enforce the desired invariances without any additional training. We show how neural architectures can leverage these relative representations to guarantee, in practice, invariance to latent isometries and rescalings, effectively enabling latent space communication: from zero-shot model stitching to latent space comparison between diverse settings. We extensively validate the generalization capability of our approach on different datasets, spanning various modalities (images, text, graphs), tasks (e.g., classification, reconstruction) and architectures (e.g., CNNs, GCNs, transformers).},

VICE uses variational inference to obtain sparse, non-negative representations of object concepts with uncertainty estimates for the embedding values. These estimates are used to automatically select the dimensions that best explain the data. We derive a PAC learning bound for VICE that can be used to estimate generalization performance or determine a sufficient sample size for experimental design. VICE rivals or outperforms its predecessor, SPoSE, at predicting human behavior in the triplet odd-one-out task. Furthermore, VICE's object representations are more reproducible and consistent across random initializations, highlighting the unique advantage of using VICE for deriving interpretable embeddings from human behavior.},

  abstract = {Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology given that interactions shape the composition and functioning of microbial communities. However, predicting microbial interactions is challenging because they can vary considerably depending on species' metabolic capabilities and environmental conditions. Here, we employ machine learning models to predict pairwise interactions between culturable bacteria based on their phylogeny, monoculture growth capabilities, and interactions with other species. We trained our models on one of the largest available pairwise interactions data set containing over 7,500 interactions between 20 species from two taxonomic groups that were cocultured in 40 different carbon environments. Our models accurately predicted both the sign (accuracy of 88\%) and the strength of effects (R2 of 0.87) species had on each other's growth. Encouragingly, predictions with comparable accuracy could be made even when not relying on information about interactions with other species, which are often hard to measure. However, species' monoculture growth was essential to the model, as predictions based solely on species' phylogeny and inferred metabolic capabilities were significantly less accurate. These results bring us one step closer to a predictive understanding of microbial communities, which is essential for engineering beneficial microbial consortia. IMPORTANCE In order to understand the function and structure of microbial communities, one must know all pairwise interactions that occur between the different species within the community, as these interactions shape the community's structure and functioning. However, measuring all pairwise interactions can be an extremely difficult task especially when dealing with big complex communities. Because of that, predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we use machine learning models in order to accurately predict the type and strength of interactions. We trained our models on one of the largest available pairwise interactions data set, containing over 7,500 interactions between 20 different species that were cocultured in 40 different environments. Our results show that, in general, accurate predictions can be made, and that the ability of each species to grow on its own in the given environment contributes the most to predictions. Being able to predict microbial interactions would put us one step closer to predicting the functionality of microbial communities and to rationally microbiome engineering.},

  abstract = {How can we tell whether two neural networks are utilizing the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of both neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of neural dynamics, which do not have a simple one-to-one mapping with geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics. Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare these linear approximations via a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. Via four case studies, we demonstrate that our method effectively identifies and distinguishes dynamic structure in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), whereas geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method therefore opens the door to novel data-driven analyses of the temporal structure of neural computation, and to more rigorous testing of RNNs as models of the brain.},

  abstract = {The anatomy of the brain necessarily~constrains its function, but precisely how remains unclear. The classical and dominant paradigm in neuroscience is that neuronal dynamics are driven by interactions between discrete, functionally specialized cell populations connected by a complex array of axonal fibres1--3. However, predictions from neural field theory, an established mathematical framework for modelling large-scale brain activity4--6, suggest that the geometry of the brain may represent a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity7,8. Here, we confirm these theoretical predictions by analysing human magnetic resonance imaging data acquired under spontaneous and diverse task-evoked conditions. Specifically, we show that cortical and subcortical activity can be parsimoniously understood as resulting from excitations of fundamental, resonant modes of the brain's geometry (that is, its shape) rather than from modes of complex interregional connectivity, as classically assumed. We then use these geometric modes to show that task-evoked activations across over 10,000 brain maps are not confined to focal areas, as widely believed, but instead excite brain-wide modes with wavelengths spanning over 60\,mm. Finally, we confirm predictions that the close link between geometry and function is explained by a dominant role for wave-like activity, showing that wave dynamics can reproduce numerous canonical spatiotemporal properties of spontaneous and evoked recordings. Our findings challenge prevailing views and identify a previously underappreciated role of geometry in shaping function, as predicted by a unifying and physically principled model of brain-wide dynamics.},

  abstract = {Exploiting the wealth of imaging and non-imaging information for disease prediction tasks requires models capable of representing, at the same time, individual features as well as data associations between subjects from potentially large populations. Graphs provide a natural framework for such tasks, yet previous graph-based approaches focus on pairwise similarities without modelling the subjects' individual characteristics and features. On the other hand, relying solely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors fails to model the interaction and similarity between subjects, which can reduce performance. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for brain analysis in populations, combining imaging and non-imaging data. We represent populations as a sparse graph where its vertices are associated with image-based feature vectors and the edges encode phenotypic information. This structure was used to train a GCN model on partially labelled graphs, aiming to infer the classes of unlabelled nodes from the node features and pairwise associations between subjects. We demonstrate the potential of the method on the challenging ADNI and ABIDE databases, as a proof of concept of the benefit from integrating contextual information in classification tasks. This has a clear impact on the quality of the predictions, leading to 69.5\% accuracy for ABIDE (outperforming the current state of the art of 66.8\%) and 77\% for ADNI for prediction of MCI conversion, significantly outperforming standard linear classifiers where only individual features are considered.},

This is challenging in behaving animals if the brain moves and deforms. The traditional approach is to train a convolutional neural network with ground-truth (GT) annotations of images representing different brain postures. For 3D images, this is very labor intensive. We introduce `targeted augmentation', a method to automatically synthesize artificial annotations from a few manual annotations. Our method (`Targettrack') learns the internal deformations of the brain to synthesize annotations for new postures by deforming GT annotations. This reduces the need for manual annotation and proofreading. A graphical user interface allows the application of the method end-to-end. We demonstrate Targettrack on recordings where neurons are labeled as key points or 3D volumes. Analyzing freely moving animals exposed to odor pulses, we uncover rich patterns in interneuron dynamics, including switching neuronal entrainment on and off.},

Compared to other structure-function coupling approaches, the strength of NCT lies in its capacity to predict the patterns of external control signals that may alter dynamics in a desired way. We have extensively developed and validated the application of NCT to the human structural connectome. Through these efforts, we have studied (i) how different aspects of connectome topology affect neural dynamics, (ii) whether NCT outputs cohere with empirical data on brain function and stimulation, and (iii) how NCT outputs vary across development and correlate with behavior and mental health symptoms. In this protocol, we introduce a framework for applying NCT to structural connectomes following two main pathways. Our primary pathway focuses on computing the control energy associated with transitioning between specific neural activity states. Our second pathway focuses on computing average controllability, which indexes nodes' general capacity to control dynamics. We also provide recommendations for comparing NCT outputs against null network models. Finally, we support this protocol with a Python-based software package called network control theory for python (nctpy).},

Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45\,million papers and 3.9\,million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric---the CD index12---that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13--17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the `shoulders of giants' view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

Recently, autoregressive transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance for anomaly detection in medical imaging. Nonetheless, these models still have some intrinsic weaknesses, such as requiring images to be modelled as 1D sequences, the accumulation of errors during the sampling process, and the significant inference times associated with transformers. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are a class of non-autoregressive generative models recently shown to produce excellent samples in computer vision (surpassing Generative Adversarial Networks), and to achieve log-likelihoods that are competitive with transformers while having relatively fast inference times. Diffusion models can be applied to the latent representations learnt by autoencoders, making them easily scalable and great candidates for application to high dimensional data, such as medical images. Here, we propose a method based on diffusion models to detect and segment anomalies in brain imaging. By training the models on healthy data and then exploring its diffusion and reverse steps across its Markov chain, we can identify anomalous areas in the latent space and hence identify anomalies in the pixel space. Our diffusion models achieve competitive performance compared with autoregressive approaches across a series of experiments with 2D CT and MRI data involving synthetic and real pathological lesions with much reduced inference times, making their usage clinically viable.},

Deep neural networks (DNNs) learn millions of parameters associated with a series of transformations defined by the model architecture, resulting in highdimensional, difficult-to-interpret internal representations of input data. As DNNs become more ubiquitous across multiple sectors of our society, there is increasing recognition that mathematical methods are needed to aid analysts, researchers, and practitioners in understanding and interpreting how these models' internal representations relate to the final classification. In this paper, we apply cutting edge techniques from TDA with the goal of gaining insight into the interpretability of convolutional neural networks used for image classification. We use two common TDA approaches to explore several methods for modeling hidden-layer activations as high-dimensional point clouds, and provide experimental evidence that these point clouds capture valuable structural information about the model's process. First, we demonstrate that a distance metric based on persistent homology can be used to quantify meaningful differences between layers, and we discuss these distances in the broader context of existing representational similarity metrics for neural network interpretability. Second, we show that a mapper graph can provide semantic insight into how these models organize hierarchical class knowledge at each layer. These observations demonstrate that TDA is a useful tool to help deep learning practitioners unlock the hidden structures of their models.},

Our goal is to automate the process of extracting the geometrical properties of the DA-G20 cells from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which is otherwise a laborious and costly process. These geometric properties are a biofilm phenotype that allow us to understand how the biofilm structurally adapts to the surface properties of the underlying metals, which can lead to better corrosion prevention solutions. We adapt two deep learning models: (a) a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to achieve semantic segmentation of the cells, (d) a mask region-convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model to achieve instance segmentation of the cells. These models are then integrated with moment invariants approach to measure the geometric characteristics of the segmented cells. Our numerical studies confirm that the Mask-RCNN and DCNN methods are 227x and 70x faster respectively, compared to the traditional method of manual identification and measurement of the cell geometric properties by the domain experts.},

Here, to better understand the relationship between the structure and the function of a nervous system, we systematically measure signal propagation in 23,433 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from model predictions that are based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle-dependent signalling,~including on timescales of less than a~second, that evoke acute calcium transients---often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that, in such cases, extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function to that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts the neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than do models based on anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and extrasynaptic signalling drive neural dynamics on short timescales, and that measurements of evoked signal propagation are crucial for interpreting neural function.},

  abstract = {Transformer-based language models such as BERT and its variants have found widespread use in natural language processing (NLP). A common way of using these models is to fine-tune them to improve their performance on a specific task. However, it is currently unclear how the fine-tuning process affects the underlying structure of the word embeddings from these models. We present TopoBERT, a visual analytics system for interactively exploring the fine-tuning process of various transformer-based models -- across multiple fine-tuning batch updates, subsequent layers of the model, and different NLP tasks -- from a topological perspective. The system uses the mapper algorithm from topological data analysis (TDA) to generate a graph that approximates the shape of a model's embedding space for an input dataset. TopoBERT enables its users (e.g. experts in NLP and linguistics) to (1) interactively explore the fine-tuning process across different model-task pairs, (2) visualize the shape of embedding spaces at multiple scales and layers, and (3) connect linguistic and contextual information about the input dataset with the topology of the embedding space. Using TopoBERT, we provide various use cases to exemplify its applications in exploring fine-tuned word embeddings. We further demonstrate the utility of TopoBERT, which enables users to generate insights about the fine-tuning process and provides support for empirical validation of these insights.},

However, increasing evidence shows that, particularly in image analysis, metrics are often chosen inadequately. Although taking into account the individual strengths, weaknesses and limitations of validation metrics is a critical prerequisite to making educated choices, the relevant knowledge is currently scattered and poorly accessible to individual researchers. Based on a multistage Delphi process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert consortium as well as extensive community feedback, the present work provides a reliable and comprehensive common point of access to information on pitfalls related to validation metrics in image analysis. Although focused on biomedical image analysis, the addressed pitfalls generalize across application domains and are categorized according to a newly created, domain-agnostic taxonomy. The work serves to enhance global comprehension of a key topic in image analysis validation.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables---colliders and mediators---should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations), which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements1,2. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. Here we introduce FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pretrained LLM with a systematic evaluator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best-known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches3. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics---the cap set problem---we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. We showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.},

Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics and neural representations in artificial and biological systems, and we highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning.},

  abstract = {The human brain sets itself apart from that of its primate relatives by specific neuroanatomical features, especially the strong linkage of left perisylvian language areas (frontal and temporal cortex) by way of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). AF connectivity has been shown to correlate with verbal working memory---a specifically human trait providing the foundation for language abilities---but a mechanistic explanation of any related causal link between anatomical structure and cognitive function is still missing. Here, we provide a possible explanation and link, by using neurocomputational simulations in neuroanatomically structured models of the perisylvian language cortex. We compare networks mimicking key features of cortical connectivity in monkeys and humans, specifically the presence of relatively stronger higher-order ``jumping links'' between nonadjacent perisylvian cortical areas in the latter, and demonstrate that the emergence of working memory for syllables and word forms is a functional consequence of this structural evolutionary change. We also show that a mere increase of learning time is not sufficient, but that this specific structural feature, which entails higher connectivity degree of relevant areas and shorter sensorimotor path length, is crucial. These results offer a better understanding of specifically human anatomical features underlying the language faculty and their evolutionary selection advantage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Why do humans have superior language abilities compared to primates? Recently, a uniquely human neuroanatomical feature has been demonstrated in the strength of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), a fiber pathway interlinking the left-hemispheric language areas. Although AF anatomy has been related to linguistic skills, an explanation of how this fiber bundle may support language abilities is still missing. We use neuroanatomically structured computational models to investigate the consequences of evolutionary changes in language area connectivity and demonstrate that the human-specific higher connectivity degree and comparatively shorter sensorimotor path length implicated by the AF entail emergence of verbal working memory, a prerequisite for language learning. These results offer a better understanding of specifically human anatomical features for language and their evolutionary selection advantage.},

Conventional autoencoders employ symmetric encoding-decoding procedures and a simple Euclidean latent space to detect hidden low-dimensional structures in an unsupervised way. This work introduces a chart autoencoder with an asymmetric encoding-decoding process that can incorporate additional semi-supervised information such as class labels. Besides enhancing the capability for handling data with complicated topological and geometric structures, these models can successfully differentiate nearby but disjoint manifolds and intersecting manifolds with only a small amount of supervision. Moreover, this model only requires a low complexity encoder, such as local linear projection. We discuss the theoretical approximation power of such networks that essentially depends on the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold and not the dimension of the observations. Our numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data verify that the proposed model can effectively manage data with multi-class nearby but disjoint manifolds of different classes, overlapping manifolds, and manifolds with non-trivial topology.},

  abstract = {The internal representations of early deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) were found to be remarkably similar to the internal neural representations measured experimentally in the primate brain. Here we ask, as deep ANNs have continued to evolve, are they becoming more or less brain-like? ANNs that are most functionally similar to the brain will contain mechanisms that are most like those used by the brain. We therefore developed Brain-Score -- a composite of multiple neural and behavioral benchmarks that score any ANN on how similar it is to the brain's mechanisms for core object recognition -- and we deployed it to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art deep ANNs. Using this scoring system, we here report that: (1) DenseNet-169, CORnet-S and ResNet-101 are the most brain-like ANNs. There remains considerable variability in neural and behavioral responses that is not predicted by any ANN, suggesting that no ANN model has yet captured all the relevant mechanisms. (3) Extending prior work, we found that gains in ANN ImageNet performance led to gains on Brain-Score. However, correlation weakened at {$\geq$} 70\% top-1 ImageNet performance, suggesting that additional guidance from neuroscience is needed to make further advances in capturing brain mechanisms. (4) We uncovered smaller (i.e. less complex) ANNs that are more brain-like than many of the best-performing ImageNet models, which suggests the opportunity to simplify ANNs to better understand the ventral stream. The scoring system used here is far from complete. However, we propose that evaluating and tracking model-benchmark correspondences through a Brain-Score that is regularly updated with new brain data is an exciting opportunity: experimental benchmarks can be used to guide machine network evolution, and machine networks are mechanistic hypotheses of the brain's network and thus drive next experiments. To facilitate both of these, we release Brain-Score.org: a platform that hosts the neural and behavioral benchmarks, where ANNs for visual processing can be submitted to receive a Brain-Score and their rank relative to other models, and where new experimental data can be naturally incorporated.},

An individual's computational phenotype is defined as a set of mechanistically interpretable parameters obtained from fitting computational models to behavioural data. However, the interpretation of these parameters hinges critically on their psychometric properties, which are rarely studied. To identify the sources governing the temporal variability of the computational phenotype, we carried out a 12-week longitudinal study using a battery of seven tasks that measure aspects of human learning, memory, perception and decision making. To examine the influence of state effects, each week, participants provided reports tracking their mood, habits and daily activities. We developed a dynamic computational phenotyping framework, which allowed us to tease apart the time-varying effects of practice and internal states such as affective valence and arousal. Our results show that many phenotype dimensions covary with practice and affective factors, indicating that what appears to be unreliability may reflect previously unmeasured structure. These results support a fundamentally dynamic understanding of cognitive variability within an individual.},

  abstract = {This review connects several lines of research to argue that hyperbolic geometry should be broadly applicable to neural circuits as well as other biological circuits. The reason for this is that networks that conform to hyperbolic geometry are maximally responsive to external and internal perturbations. These networks also allow for efficient communication under conditions where nodes are added or removed. We will argue that one of the signatures of hyperbolic geometry is the celebrated Zipf's law (also sometimes known as the Pareto distribution) that states that the probability to observe a given pattern is inversely related to its rank. Zipf's law is observed in a variety of biological systems --- from protein sequences, neural networks to economics. These observations provide further evidence for the ubiquity of networks with an underlying hyperbolic metric structure. Recent studies in neuroscience specifically point to the relevance of a three-dimensional hyperbolic space for neural signaling. The three-dimensional hyperbolic space may confer additional robustness compared to other dimensions. We illustrate how the use of hyperbolic coordinates revealed a novel topographic organization within the olfactory system. The use of such coordinates may facilitate representation of relevant signals elsewhere in the brain.},

Recent work has shown that neural networks can learn such symmetries directly from data using Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs). But HNNs struggle when trained on datasets where energy is not conserved. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to identify and decompose conservative and dissipative dynamics simultaneously. We propose Dissipative Hamiltonian Neural Networks (D-HNNs), which parameterize both a Hamiltonian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Taken together, they represent an implicit Helmholtz decomposition which can separate dissipative effects such as friction from symmetries such as conservation of energy. We train our model to decompose a damped mass-spring system into its friction and inertial terms and then show that this decomposition can be used to predict dynamics for unseen friction coefficients. Then we apply our model to real world data including a large, noisy ocean current dataset where decomposing the velocity field yields useful scientific insights.},

  abstract = {Segmentation of anatomical shapes from medical images has taken an important role in the automation of clinical measurements. While typical deep-learning segmentation approaches are performed on discrete voxels, the underlying objects being analysed exist in a real-valued continuous space. Approaches that rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are limited to grid-like inputs and not easily applicable to sparse or partial measurements. We propose a novel family of image segmentation models that tackle many of CNNs' shortcomings: Neural Implicit Segmentation Functions (NISF). Our framework takes inspiration from the field of neural implicit functions where a network learns a mapping from a real-valued coordinate-space to a shape representation. NISFs have the ability to segment anatomical shapes in high-dimensional continuous spaces. Training is not limited to voxelized grids, and covers applications with sparse and partial data. Interpolation between observations is learnt naturally in the training procedure and requires no post-processing. Furthermore, NISFs allow the leveraging of learnt shape priors to make predictions for regions outside of the original image plane. We go on to show the framework achieves dice scores of \$\$0.87 {\textbackslash}pm 0.045\$\$on a (3D+t) short-axis cardiac segmentation task using the UK Biobank dataset. We also provide a qualitative analysis on our frameworks ability to perform segmentation and image interpolation on unseen regions of an image volume at arbitrary resolutions.},

GCs closer to the white matter (inner-zone GCs) had higher firing thresholds and could sustain firing with larger current inputs than GCs closer to the Purkinje cell layer (outer-zone GCs). Dynamic Clamp experiments showed that inner- and outer-zone GCs preferentially respond to high- and low-frequency mossy fiber inputs, respectively, enabling dispersion of the mossy fiber input into its frequency components as performed by a Fourier transformation. Furthermore, inner-zone GCs have faster axonal conduction velocity and elicit faster synaptic potentials in Purkinje cells. Neuronal network modeling revealed that these gradients improve spike-timing precision of Purkinje cells and decrease the number of GCs required to learn spike-sequences.

  abstract = {Biological and artificial information processing systems form representations that they can use to categorize, reason, plan, navigate, and make decisions. How can we measure the extent to which the representations formed by these diverse systems agree? Do similarities in representations then translate into similar behavior? How can a system's representations be modified to better match those of another system? These questions pertaining to the study of representational alignment are at the heart of some of the most active research areas in cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. For example, cognitive scientists measure the representational alignment of multiple individuals to identify shared cognitive priors, neuroscientists align fMRI responses from multiple individuals into a shared representational space for group-level analyses, and ML researchers distill knowledge from teacher models into student models by increasing their alignment. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge transfer between research communities interested in representational alignment, so progress in one field often ends up being rediscovered independently in another. Thus, greater cross-field communication would be advantageous. To improve communication between these fields, we propose a unifying framework that can serve as a common language between researchers studying representational alignment. We survey the literature from all three fields and demonstrate how prior work fits into this framework. Finally, we lay out open problems in representational alignment where progress can benefit all three of these fields. We hope that our work can catalyze cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress for all communities studying and developing information processing systems. We note that this is a working paper and encourage readers to reach out with their suggestions for future revisions.},

  abstract = {Microbial communities are ubiquitous and often influence macroscopic properties of the ecosystems they inhabit. However, deciphering the functional relationship between specific microbes and ecosystem properties is an ongoing challenge owing to the complexity of the communities. This challenge can be addressed, in part, by integrating the advances in DNA sequencing technology with computational approaches like machine learning. Although machine learning techniques have been applied to microbiome data, use of these techniques remains rare, and user-friendly platforms to implement such techniques are not widely available. We developed a tool that implements neural network and random forest models to perform regression and feature selection tasks on microbiome data. In this study, we applied the tool to analyze soil microbiome (16S rRNA gene profiles) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) data from a 44-day plant litter decomposition experiment. The microbiome data includes 1709 total bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTU) from 300+ microcosms. Regression analysis of predicted and actual DOC for a held-out test set of 51 samples yield Pearson's correlation coefficients of.636 and.676 for neural network and random forest approaches, respectively. Important taxa identified by the machine learning techniques are compared to results from a standard tool (indicator species analysis) widely used by microbial ecologists. Of 1709 bacterial taxa, indicator species analysis identified 285 taxa as significant determinants of DOC concentration. Of the top 285 ranked features determined by machine learning methods, a subset of 86 taxa are common to all feature selection techniques. Using this subset of features, prediction results for random permutations of the data set are at least equally accurate compared to predictions determined using the entire feature set. Our results suggest that integration of multiple methods can aid identification of a robust subset of taxa within complex communities that may drive specific functional outcomes of interest.},

Deep artificial neural networks have emerged as the leading such predictive models of the visual system but are less explored in audition. Prior work provided examples of audio-trained neural networks that produced good predictions of auditory cortical fMRI responses and exhibited correspondence between model stages and brain regions, but left it unclear whether these results generalize to other neural network models and, thus, how to further improve models in this domain. We evaluated model-brain correspondence for publicly available audio neural network models along with in-house models trained on 4 different tasks. Most tested models outpredicted standard spectromporal filter-bank models of auditory cortex and exhibited systematic model-brain correspondence: Middle stages best predicted primary auditory cortex, while deep stages best predicted non-primary cortex. However, some state-of-the-art models produced substantially worse brain predictions. Models trained to recognize speech in background noise produced better brain predictions than models trained to recognize speech in quiet, potentially because hearing in noise imposes constraints on biological auditory representations. The training task influenced the prediction quality for specific cortical tuning properties, with best overall predictions resulting from models trained on multiple tasks. The results generally support the promise of deep neural networks as models of audition, though they also indicate that current models do not explain auditory cortical responses in their entirety.},

  abstract = {The relationship between perception and inference, as postulated by Helmholtz in the 19th century, is paralleled in modern machine learning by generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their hierarchical variants. Here, we evaluate the role of hierarchical inference and its alignment with brain function in the domain of motion perception. We first introduce a novel synthetic data framework, Retinal Optic Flow Learning (ROFL), which enables control over motion statistics and their causes. We then present a new hierarchical VAE and test it against alternative models on two downstream tasks: (i) predicting ground truth causes of retinal optic flow (e.g., self-motion); and (ii) predicting the responses of neurons in the motion processing pathway of primates. We manipulate the model architectures (hierarchical versus non-hierarchical), loss functions, and the causal structure of the motion stimuli. We find that hierarchical latent structure in the model leads to several improvements. First, it improves the linear decodability of ground truth factors and does so in a sparse and disentangled manner. Second, our hierarchical VAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in predicting neuronal responses and exhibits sparse latent-to-neuron relationships. These results depend on the causal structure of the world, indicating that alignment between brains and artificial neural networks depends not only on architecture but also on matching ecologically relevant stimulus statistics. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchical Bayesian inference underlines the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model this understanding.},

  abstract = {Large transformers are powerful architectures used for self-supervised data analysis across various data types, including protein sequences, images, and text. In these models, the semantic structure of the dataset emerges from a sequence of transformations between one representation and the next. We characterize the geometric and statistical properties of these representations and how they change as we move through the layers. By analyzing the intrinsic dimension (ID) and neighbor composition, we find that the representations evolve similarly in transformers trained on protein language tasks and image reconstruction tasks. In the first layers, the data manifold expands, becoming high-dimensional, and then contracts significantly in the intermediate layers. In the last part of the model, the ID remains approximately constant or forms a second shallow peak. We show that the semantic information of the dataset is better expressed at the end of the first peak, and this phenomenon can be observed across many models trained on diverse datasets. Based on our findings, we point out an explicit strategy to identify, without supervision, the layers that maximize semantic content: representations at intermediate layers corresponding to a relative minimum of the ID profile are more suitable for downstream learning tasks.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool, capable of solving challenging problems in high-profile sectors. To perform counterfactual inference, we require knowledge of the underlying causal mechanisms. However, causal mechanisms cannot be uniquely determined from observations and interventions alone. This raises the question of how to choose the causal mechanisms so that the resulting counterfactual inference is trustworthy in a given domain. This question has been addressed in causal models with binary variables, but for the case of categorical variables, it remains unanswered. We address this challenge by introducing for causal models with categorical variables the notion of counterfactual ordering, a principle positing desirable properties that causal mechanisms should possess and prove that it is equivalent to specific functional constraints on the causal mechanisms. To learn causal mechanisms satisfying these constraints, and perform counterfactual inference with them, we introduce deep twin networks. These are deep neural networks that, when trained, are capable of twin network counterfactual inference---an alternative to the abduction--action--prediction method. We empirically test our approach on diverse real-world and semisynthetic data from medicine, epidemiology and finance, reporting accurate estimation of counterfactual probabilities while demonstrating the issues that arise with counterfactual reasoning when counterfactual ordering is not enforced},

Here we mathematically prove that simple biological constraints on neurons, namely nonnegativity and energy efficiency in both activity and weights, promote such sought after disentangled representations by enforcing neurons to become selective for single factors of task variation. We demonstrate these constraints lead to disentanglement in a variety of tasks and architectures, including variational autoencoders. We also use this theory to explain why the brain partitions its cells into distinct cell types such as grid and object-vector cells, and also explain when the brain instead entangles representations in response to entangled task factors. Overall, this work provides a mathematical understanding of why single neurons in the brain often represent single human-interpretable factors, and steps towards an understanding task structure shapes the structure of brain representation.},

  abstract = {Generative models have been shown to provide a powerful mechanism for anomaly detection by learning to model healthy or normal reference data which can subsequently be used as a baseline for scoring anomalies. In this work we consider denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for unsupervised anomaly detection. DDPMs have superior mode coverage over generative adversarial networks (GANs) and higher sample quality than variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, this comes at the expense of poor scalability and increased sampling times due to the long Markov chain sequences required. We observe that within reconstruction-based anomaly detection a full-length Markov chain diffusion is not required. This leads us to develop a novel partial diffusion anomaly detection strategy that scales to high-resolution imagery, named AnoDDPM. A secondary problem is that Gaussian diffusion fails to capture larger anomalies; therefore we develop a multi-scale simplex noise diffusion process that gives control over the target anomaly size. AnoDDPM with simplex noise is shown to significantly outperform both f-AnoGAN and Gaussian diffusion for the tumorous dataset of 22 T1weighted MRI scans (CCBS Edinburgh) qualitatively and quantitatively (improvement of +25.5\% S{\o}rensen--Dice coefficient, +17.6\% IoU and +7.4\% AUC).},

  abstract = {Recently, attention mechanisms have significantly boosted the performance of natural language processing using deep learning. An attention mechanism can select the information to be used, such as by conducting a dictionary lookup; this information is then used, for example, to select the next utterance word in a sentence. In neuroscience, the basis of the function of sequentially selecting words is considered to be the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Here, we first show that the attention mechanism used in deep learning corresponds to the mechanism in which the cerebral basal ganglia suppress thalamic relay cells in the brain. Next, we demonstrate that, in neuroscience, the output of the basal ganglia is associated with the action output in the actor of reinforcement learning. Based on these, we show that the aforementioned loop can be generalized as reinforcement learning that controls the transmission of the prediction signal so as to maximize the prediction reward. We call this attentional reinforcement learning (ARL). In ARL, the actor selects the information transmission route according to the attention, and the prediction signal changes according to the context detected by the information source of the route. Hence, ARL enables flexible action selection that depends on the situation, unlike traditional reinforcement learning, wherein the actor must directly select an action.},

While elegant, information theoretic properties are notoriously difficult to measure in practical settings or to employ as objective functions in optimization. This difficulty has necessitated that computational models designed to test the hypothesis employ several different information metrics ranging from approximations and lower bounds to proxy measures like reconstruction error. Recent theoretical advances have characterized a novel and ecologically relevant efficiency metric, the manifold capacity, which is the number of object categories that may be represented in a linearly separable fashion. However, calculating manifold capacity is a computationally intensive iterative procedure that until now has precluded its use as an objective. Here we outline the simplifying assumptions that allow manifold capacity to be optimized directly, yielding Maximum Manifold Capacity Representations (MMCR). The resulting method is closely related to and inspired by advances in the field of self supervised learning (SSL), and we demonstrate that MMCRs are competitive with state of the art results on standard SSL benchmarks. Empirical analyses reveal differences between MMCRs and representations learned by other SSL frameworks, and suggest a mechanism by which manifold compression gives rise to class separability. Finally we evaluate a set of SSL methods on a suite of neural predictivity benchmarks, and find MMCRs are higly competitive as models of the ventral stream.},

  abstract = {Drug--drug interactions (DDIs) for emerging drugs offer possibilities for treating and alleviating diseases, and accurately predicting these with computational methods can improve patient care and contribute to efficient drug development. However, many existing computational methods require large amounts of known DDI information, which is scarce for emerging drugs. Here we propose EmerGNN, a graph neural network that can effectively predict interactions for emerging drugs by leveraging the rich information in biomedical networks. EmerGNN learns pairwise representations of drugs by extracting the paths between drug pairs, propagating information from one drug to the other, and incorporating the relevant biomedical concepts on the paths. The edges of the biomedical network are weighted to indicate the relevance for the target DDI prediction. Overall, EmerGNN has higher accuracy than existing approaches in predicting interactions for emerging drugs and can identify the most relevant information on the biomedical network.},

  abstract = {Daily experience suggests that we perceive distances near us linearly. However, the actual geometry of spatial representation in the brain is unknown. Here we report that neurons in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus that mediate spatial perception represent space according to a non-linear hyperbolic geometry. This geometry uses an exponential scale and yields greater positional information than a linear scale. We found that the size of the representation matches the optimal predictions for the number of CA1 neurons. The representations also dynamically expanded proportional to the logarithm of time that the animal spent exploring the environment, in correspondence with the maximal mutual information that can be received. The dynamic changes tracked even small variations due to changes in the running speed of the animal. These results demonstrate how neural circuits achieve efficient representations using dynamic hyperbolic geometry.},

  abstract = {The human brain is a complex neurobiological system exhibiting complex nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to study brain activity, whole-brain nonlinear dynamics in fMRI data have not been extensively examined. The present study applied phase space embedding on resting-state fMRI data and characterized their phase space dynamics with the sum of lengths of portrait edges (SE) in the reconstructed phase portrait. The effects of repetition time (TR), bandpass filtering and the added noise power of BOLD signals on the optimal embedding parameters (embedding time delay {$\tau$} and embedding dimension m) were examined with experimental or simulated fMRI data. Our results show that {$\tau$} and m vary with the three acquisition parameters. The present method was applied to the autism spectrum disorder dataset from Autism Imaging Data Exchange I to demonstrate its capability in the characterization of abnormal brain dynamics. The resultant SE maps were statistically compared between patients and controls, and the significant differences in SE were fed into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. A significant increase in SE in the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN), as well as the visual network, was found in autistic patients. With the SE features of these regions, our SVM classifier achieved superior accuracy (74.55\% with 10-folds cross validation) compared with prior studies, indicating that phase space embedding and SE mapping are promising in characterizing the nonlinear dynamics of the BOLD signal and might be useful for brain biomarker discovery in clinical psychiatry.},

  abstract = {The mapper graph is a popular tool from topological data analysis that provides a graphical summary of point cloud data. It has been used to study data from cancer research, sports analytics, neurosciences, and machine learning. In particular, mapper graphs have been used recently to visualize the topology of high-dimensional artificial neural activations from convolutional neural networks and large language models. However, a key question that arises from using mapper graphs across applications is how to compare mapper graphs to study their structural differences. In this paper, we introduce a distance between mapper graphs using tools from optimal transport. We demonstrate the utility of such a distance by studying the topological changes of neural activations across convolutional layers in deep learning, as well as by capturing the loss of structural information for a multiscale mapper.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we identify and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering (RepE), an approach to enhancing the transparency of AI systems that draws on insights from cognitive neuroscience. RepE places population-level representations, rather than neurons or circuits, at the center of analysis, equipping us with novel methods for monitoring and manipulating high-level cognitive phenomena in deep neural networks (DNNs). We provide baselines and an initial analysis of RepE techniques, showing that they offer simple yet effective solutions for improving our understanding and control of large language models. We showcase how these methods can provide traction on a wide range of safety-relevant problems, including honesty, harmlessness, power-seeking, and more, demonstrating the promise of top-down transparency research. We hope that this work catalyzes further exploration of RepE and fosters advancements in the transparency and safety of AI systems.},
